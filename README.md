## Python documentation for learning

Hello, I'm taking a course on udemy.com to learn Python. I made my own documentation.

I would like to thank udemy.com and especially the trainer: Jean-Philippe Parein for his course on Python.

I also thank the book : Python pour les nuls 4th edition by John Paul Mueller.

And also the book on Amazon kindle: Python for beginners by Daniel Correa - Paola Vallejo - Ronald Martinod.
